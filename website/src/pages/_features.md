<li>

#### ASN.1 Object Encoding/Decoding

Encode and decode ASN.1 objects, allowing for the serialization and deserialization of data structures according to the ASN.1 specifications.

</li>

<li>

#### BER, DER, and CER Support

Support for Basic Encoding Rules (BER), Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER), and Canonical Encoding Rules (CER), which are different encoding rules for ASN.1.

</li>

<li>

#### Universal, Application, Context-Specific Tag Support

Handle different ASN.1 tag types, including universal tags, application-specific tags, and context-specific tags.

</li>

<li>

#### Constructive and Primitive Encoding

Support for both primitive and constructed encoding, allowing the representation of simple values (primitive) and more complex structures (constructed).

</li>

<li>

#### OID (Object Identifier) Handling

Ability to work with Object Identifiers, which are a hierarchical tree of identifiers commonly used in ASN.1 to uniquely identify objects, types, and attributes.

</li>

<li>

#### Extension Support

Ability to handle ASN.1 extensions, which are used to extend existing data structures without modifying their original definition.

</li>
